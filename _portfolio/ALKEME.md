### Engineering Stack Vision (Proposal)

This section outlines a high-level engineering stack vision for a greenfield rollout with Kubernetes as the runtime and Azure as the cloud provider, balancing developer freedom and velocity with sensible security and operations readiness.

**Goal:** To deliver a modern, fast, secure, scalable, auditable, developer-friendly platform for building and operating containerized applications using Kubernetes. Provide standardized CI/CD pipelines to support rapid innovation. Minimize manual work, reduce human error, and increase development velocity with automation and infrastructure-as-code, centralize secrets & key management. Provide visibility into every layer of infrastructure and code with observability and feedback loops. Provide operational resilience via backup, disaster recovery, and helpdesk support. Support experimentation and flexibility without compromising safety by embedding security into every stage with layered security and compliance-ready processes.

**High-Level Components:**

*   **Source Control:** Git-centric workflows with branch protection and PR gates.
*   **CI Orchestration:** Jenkins for builds/tests.
*   **Continuous Code Scanning:** CodeQL to identify vulnerabilities and bugs.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform to create a hub-and-spoke architecture.
*   **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault as the single source of secrets.
*   **Access Control:** Policy-driven and role-based access within Azure Active Directory.
*   **Observability:** Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
*   **Log Management:** ELK and Azure Monitor for log analysis.
*   **Early Alerting:** SLO (Service Level Objective) implementation.

This framework lays the foundation for a secure, scalable environment, balancing speed with guardrails and resilience for enterprise-grade reliability. Adopting this framework ensures every commit and deployment is backed by the best tooling, security, and practices to enable rapid delivery.
