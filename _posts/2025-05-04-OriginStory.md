title: Origin Story
---

Code is more than logic—it’s magic. To builds futures, To shapes communities, and To turns ideas into reality. This is my story of how I fell in love with my craft."

My name is Jamall Harris, and at my core, I’m a builder, inventor, and innovator. Not just of code, but of systems, spaces, and stories that matter. I’m a software engineer with a heart for community and a mind wired for compassion. For me, technology isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about asking better questions, nurturing more possibility, and leaving things better than I found them.

I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama — a city steeped in struggle, resilience, and tradition. That spirit shaped me. I earned my Bacholars in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2017, but the real learning began long before graduation. At UAB, I was a part SEAP, the Software Engineering and Prototyping Lab, where we did more than study theory — we brought ideas to life. We built full-stack applications, explored new frameworks, and turned the lab into launchpad.

My passion for security and  thinking led me to SPIES, a research lab focused on security and privacy. I worked alongside the FBI, developing geo-tagging tools used in real-world phishing investigations. It was my first experience writing code with tangible, immediate impact — and it changed how I thought about responsibility in tech.

That summer, I interned at Google. The culture of curiosity, intensity, and constant iteration made a lasting impression. I was offered a junior dev role in Mountain View, and though it lasted shortly, the expereince left a lasting impression on how I approach code.  


My final semester brought another meaningful opportunity: working with a Biology Research Lab through my Capstone project. I implemented genetic sequencing algorithms across a shared high performance computing cluster — and that work led directly to my first job after graduation.

But even with a full-time career, I never stopped creating on my own terms. I founded Absolute Infinity LLC, my personal  launchpad for projects that serve, empower, and uplift the community. Over the years, I've used that platform to prototype tools, mentor students, and help small business bring there ideas to life. Through TEALS, First Robotics, and McWane Science Center, I supported helping the next generation fall in love with STEM the way I did. 


Professionally, I’ve had the privilege to work across many industries — from healthcare, marketing, banking and research — at places like Influence Health, BIG Communications, and Intermark Group to name a few, taking on roles that ranged from frontend design to backend engineering. At BBVA Compass, I stepped into a hybrid DevOps/SDET role, building custom testing frameworks and internal deployment tools to improve software quality and developer experience.

In 2018, I joined Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) in Atlanta, where I continued scaling infrastructure and streamlining deployment pipelines in the cloud. There, I helped build resilient, automated systems using AWS, microservices, and modern CI/CD strategies.



Through it all, I’ve remained grounded in one truth: code is a tool, but people are the purpose.

My origin story — rooted in logic, fueled by passion, and always connected to community. I built with intention, I innovated with care, and I am deeply grounded in the impact of my craft. 

My name is Jamall Harris, a software engineer with a deep love for innovation, tinkering, and purpose-driven technology. I earned my BSc in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2017. I’ve always believed that code is more than logic—it’s magic. A language that, when spoken fluently, can shape communities, build futures, and bring ideas to life.
