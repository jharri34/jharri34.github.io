Are your audiobook files scattered across various folders, making it a chore to manage your listening library? The **AudiobookCopier** is here to simplify your life.

This straightforward Python script is designed for one purpose: to efficiently find and copy your `.m4b` and `.m4a` audiobook files from a source to a designated destination, ensuring your collection is neatly organized and ready for listening.

### What AudiobookCopier Does

*   **Targeted File Search:** Scans a specified directory for common audiobook formats (`.m4b`, `.m4a`).
*   **Metadata Extraction:** Reads the title and author directly from your audiobook files using the `mutagen` library.
*   **Clean Copying:** Copies files to your chosen destination, leaving your original files untouched.
*   **Clear Reporting:** Provides a concise report of all copied files, including their extracted title and author, so you always know what's been moved.
*   **Simple Configuration:** Easy-to-modify source and destination directories directly within the script.

### Why We Built It

We believe managing your digital media should be as enjoyable as consuming it. AudiobookCopier addresses the common frustration of disorganized audiobook collections, offering a simple yet effective automated solution. It's perfect for listeners who want a clean, centralized library without manual dragging and dropping.
