Is your digital photo collection a sprawling mess of unsorted images, making it impossible to find that one cherished memory? The **Photo Sorter** is here to bring order to your visual world.

This command-line tool is designed to automatically organize your photos into a clean, date-based folder structure, making your photo library easily navigable and enjoyable again.

### What Photo Sorter Does

*   **Intelligent Date-Based Sorting:** Organizes your photos into `YYYY/MM/` folders based on their creation or modification date.
*   **File Type Categorization:** Further sorts photos by their file type (e.g., `JPG`, `PNG`, `RAW`), creating a highly organized structure.
*   **Safe Copying:** Copies files to a new destination, ensuring your original photos remain untouched and safe.
*   **"Dry Run" Mode:** Preview exactly how your photos will be organized before any files are moved, giving you full control and peace of mind.
*   **Flexible Filtering:** Include or exclude specific file extensions, allowing you to sort only the types of photos you care about.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Easy to use from your terminal with clear options for source, destination, and sorting preferences.

In an age of ubiquitous cameras, our digital photo collections can quickly become overwhelming.
