                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded"> My name is Jamall Harris, a software engineer with a deep love for innovation, tinkering, and purpose-driven technology.
                    I earned my <strong>BSc in Computer Science & Electrical Engineering from the University of Alabama at Birmingham</strong> in 2017.
                    I’ve always believed that code is more than logic—it’s magic. A language that, when spoken fluently, can shape communities, build futures, and bring ideas to life.

                <h2 class="text-start">My Journey So Far</h2>
                <p class="text-faded"> 
                    I started my journey in the heart of Birmingham, Alabama. But my education didn’t start—or end—with a degree. 
                    At <strong>UAB</strong>, I was one of the founding members of <strong><abbr title="Software Engineer And Prototying">SEAP</abbr></strong>. 
                    Where we weren’t just studying — we were developing, and deploying full-stack applications for projects around the schools, exploring frameworks, and learning by building real, usable apps.
                    
                    I also, joined <strong><abbr title="Security and Privacy In Emerging computing and networking Systems">SPIES</abbr></strong>, a research lab focused on security and privacy.
                     There, I collaborated with the FBI, helping to developing geo-tagging software used to analyze and identify phishing scams in real world cases.
                    It was a hands-on, and high-stakes introduction to cybersecurity, and it gave me a taste of how powerful code could be.
                    
                    During that summer I was accepted into a Google internship and offered a junior developer role in Mountain View after graduation.
                    The culture and intensity left a lasting impression on how I approach code, collaboration, and innovation.
                    
                    During my final semester at <strong>UAB</strong> My Capstone class worked with a Biology Research Lab, where I implemented sequencing algorithm across a shared computing cluster.
                    That work led to a job offer right after graduation starting my career.

                <p class="text-faded">
                    Throughout this time, I remained very active in the tech community, and I launched **Absolute Infinity LLC**, a personal venture that became a lab for my ideas.
                    The company became a launchpad for dozens of creative, community-centered, projects over the years.
                    I chaired the local ACM chapter, mentored students through <strong>TEALS</strong> and <strong>First Robotics</strong> in high schools across the state, and volunteered with youth at the <strong>McWane Science Center</strong>, helping kids discover their love of STEM. 
                    In the years that followed, I worked across many fields and disciplines from healthcare to marketing —contributing to teams like <strong>Influence Health</strong> ,<strong>BIG Communications</strong>, and <strong> Intermark Group</strong>.
                    My roles spanned from frontend, to backend. 
                    Eventually, I stepped into a hybrid DevOps/SDET role at <strong>BBVA Compass</strong>. I built end-to-end testing frameworks from the ground up and developed internal tools to manage test data and improve deployment consistency.
                    In 2018, I joined the <strong>Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI)</strong> in Atlanta. I worked with a team to deploy microservices in AWS and built and maintained fully automated CI/CD pipelines and automated scripts to build and maintains a fully automated cloud infrastructure.
                    ven while growing professionally, I never stopped working on my own terms. Through Absolute Infinity, I’ve continued creating tools and platforms grounded in community impact.
                    Lately, I've developed, a tool that uses computer vision and large language model  to improve email accessibility through automated alt-text generation and dynamic email layout design, also a app, enabling smart portfolio management and AI-powered content scheduling,  a social media assistant —automating content creation and community engagement, and  a platform that uses AI clustering and real-time heatmaps to connect like minded users with shared values and identities.
                    I've also worked on platforms like RISE UP, a civic tech platform that tracks local elections and representatives, Pothole 311, an app to reports road hazards directly to city officials, and NGHBR, a digital survival toolkit for marginalized communities that blends anonymous messaging, guerrilla email, decentralized economics and map-based resource sharing focused on Black economic empowerment and Land Bank Marketplace, a real estate platform for accessing and bidding on abandoned or tax-delinquent properties, complete with mapping, data tools, and civic integration.

                    Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: engineer, founder, teacher, and mentor. Whether I’m deploying a microservice, mentoring a student, or building apps from scratch, my motto is simple:
                    <h4>Create. Innovate. Iterate.</h4>
                    I believe technology shouldn’t just automate— it should elevate. Every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to something bigger than myself.
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you’re looking for a  engineer, a  consultant, or a  partner to help with your next big idea — I’d love to connect.
