<p>I have a strong background in software development, problem-solving, and team collaboration, which has allowed me to contribute to innovative projects across various industries.</p>

<p>As a Research Scientist at Georgia Tech Research Institute, I led large-scale, multi-node application development, using technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and AWS to create scalable solutions. At BBVA Compass, I built automated testing platforms and environments for API and website testing, ensuring high-quality software delivery.</p>

<p>My time as a Software Developer at the University of Alabama gave me the opportunity to work on critical applications for the FBI and research-based projects. These experiences have shaped my ability to analyze complex systems, optimize workflows, and implement effective technical solutions.</p>

<p>I thrive in any environments that encourage innovation and creativity. I’m passionate about solving challenging problems and finding elegant solutions that make a real impact. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute to meaningful projects.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I’m excited about the future and the possibilities ahead!</p>
