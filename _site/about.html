      <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Jamall Harris, a software engineer with a deep love for innovation, tinkering, and purpose-driven technology. I earned my BSc in Computer Science &amp; Electrical Engineering from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2017. I’ve always believed that code is more than logic—it’s magic. A language that, when spoken fluently, can shape communities, build futures, and bring ideas to life.</p>

<h2 id="education---innovation">Education &amp;  Innovation</h2>
<p>My journey through software engineering began in the heart of Birmingham, Alabama. But my education didn’t start—or end—with a degree. At UAB, I became one of the founding members of SEAP, the Software Engineering and Prototyping Lab. We weren’t just studying theory—we were deploying full-stack applications, exploring mobile frameworks, and learning by building real, usable systems.</p>

<p>Around the same time, I joined SPIES, a research lab focused on security and privacy in emerging systems. There, I collaborated with the FBI, helping to develop geo-tagging software used to analyze phishing scams. It was a hands-on, high-stakes introduction to cybersecurity, and it gave me a taste of how powerful well-written code could be.</p>

<p>During my final semester, I worked in the Biology Research Lab, where I implemented a complex sequencing algorithm across a shared computing cluster. That work led to a job offer right after graduation.</p>

<p>At the same time, I launched Absolute Infinity LLC, a personal venture that became a lab for my ideas. While others were job hunting, I was meeting with clients, launching platforms, and pushing the limits of emerging technologies in the wild. The company became a launchpad for dozens of creative, community-centered, and technically ambitious projects over the years.</p>

<h2 id="growth-through-industry--community">Growth Through Industry &amp; Community</h2>
<p>That same spirit of innovation took me to California when I was accepted into a Google internship and offered a junior developer role in Mountain View.  The culture and intensity left a lasting impression on how I approach code, collaboration, and innovation.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, I worked across the healthcare and marketing technology spaces—contributing to teams at Influence Health, BIG Communications, and Intermark Group. My roles spanned frontend development, and backend integrations</p>

<p>Throughout this period, I remained active in Birmingham’s tech community. I chaired the local ACM chapter, mentored students through TEALS and First Robotics, and volunteered with youth at the McWane Science Center, helping kids ages 6 to 17 discover their love of STEM. I also found success in competitive spaces—winning Facebook’s Capture the Flag cybersecurity competition, taking top prizes at DataFest, and reaching the finals of the Smart City Hackathon.</p>

<p>Eventually, I stepped into a hybrid engineering and DevOps role at BBVA Compass. I built end-to-end testing frameworks from the ground up using Spring Boot, Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, and RestAssured. I also developed internal tools to manage test data and improve deployment consistency across departments.</p>

<p>In 2018, I joined the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) in Atlanta—a decision that elevated my technical scope. I worked with a specialized team to deploy microservices in AWS, using Kubernetes, Docker, and Ansible. I built and maintained fully automated CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Terraform, and CloudFormation</p>

<p>Even while growing professionally, I never stopped building on my own terms. Through Absolute Infinity, I’ve continued creating tools and platforms that are experimental, ambitious, and grounded in community impact.</p>

<p>I developed SendEdge, a platform that uses computer vision and large language models to improve email accessibility through automated alt-text generation and dynamic layout design. I built internal tools for Diamond Life, an art and modeling collective, enabling smart portfolio management and AI-powered content scheduling. I even engineered a social media assistant that cloned a real estate influencer’s digital voice using video, text, and audio—automating content creation and community engagement at scale.</p>

<p>From there, I launched RISE UP, a civic tech platform that tracks local elections and representatives. I created Pothole 311, an app for cyclists to report road hazards directly to city officials. I envisioned and built NGHBR, a digital survival toolkit for marginalized communities that blends anonymous messaging, guerrilla email, and map-based resource sharing focused on safety and Black economic empowerment.</p>

<p>Later came Surge, a platform that uses AI clustering and real-time heatmaps to connect users with shared values and identities. I also built the Land Bank Marketplace, a real estate platform for accessing and bidding on abandoned or tax-delinquent properties, complete with mapping, data tools, and civic integration.</p>

<h2 id="guiding-values">Guiding Values</h2>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worn many hats: engineer, strategist, founder, teacher, and mentor. Whether I’m deploying a microservice, mentoring a student, or architecting a platform from scratch, my motto remains simple:</p>

<p>Create. Innovate. Iterate.</p>

<p>I believe technology shouldn’t just automate—it should elevate. I value clarity, craftsmanship, and the ability to build something that makes a real difference. Every project is an opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute to something bigger than myself.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you’re looking for a creative engineer, a collaborative consultant, or a technical partner to help bring your next big idea to life—I’d love to connect</p>
