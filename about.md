# About page

I have a strong background in software development, problem-solving, and team collaboration, which has allowed me to contribute to innovative projects across various industries. 

As a Research Scientist at Georgia Tech Research Institute, I led large-scale, multi-node application development, using technologies like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and AWS to create scalable solutions. At BBVA Compass, I built automated testing platforms and environments for API and website testing, ensuring high-quality software delivery.

My time as a Software Developer at the University of Alabama gave me the opportunity to work on critical applications for the FBI and research-based projects. These experiences have shaped my ability to analyze complex systems, optimize workflows, and implement effective technical solutions.

I thrive in any environments that encourage innovation and creativity. I’m passionate about solving challenging problems and finding elegant solutions that make a real impact. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute to meaningful projects.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I’m excited about the future and the possibilities ahead!
